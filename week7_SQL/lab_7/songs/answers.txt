If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

By examining the average energy, valence, and danceability of the listener's top 100 songs, you can get insights
into the overall mood and atmosphere of their music taste. For example, if the average energy and danceability are high,
and the valence is also high, the listener's audio aura might be characterized as energetic, positive, and danceable.
On the other hand, if the average energy is low, valence is high, and danceability is moderate, the aura might be characterized as calm,
positive, and moderately danceable.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The calculated audio aura based on average energy, valence, and danceability for the listener's top 100 songs
may not be representative due to limitations such as:

- Limited Song Diversity: The top 100 songs may not capture the full diversity of the listener's music taste.
- Temporal Changes: Musical preferences evolve over time, and a single snapshot might not reflect changes throughout the year.
- Subjectivity of Mood: Averaging mood metrics oversimplifies the subjective and complex emotional responses to music.
- Ignoring Song Context: Simple averages may overlook the contextual interplay between different moods in specific songs.

To improve, consider weighted averages, temporal analysis, genre and artist exploration, and incorporating user ratings or feedback for a more nuanced understanding of the listener's audio aura.
