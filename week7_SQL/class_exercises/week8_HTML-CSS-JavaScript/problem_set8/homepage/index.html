                    <h1>Introduction to My CS50 Project</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Gabriel, and I am currently enrolled in the CS50 course offered by Harvard University. As part of the course requirements, I am excited to present this website as one of the exercises in the curriculum.</p>
                    <p>CS50 is an introductory computer science course that covers a wide range of topics, including algorithms, software development, and web development. It's an immersive and challenging program that encourages hands-on learning and problem-solving.</p>
                    </br>
                    <h2>The purpose about this website</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>This website serves as a practical exercise for one of the assignments in the CS50 course. Through the development of this site, I am applying the skills and knowledge gained in the course, particularly in the realm of web development.</p>
                    <p>Here, you'll find information about me, my professional background, and my journey through the CS50 course. The website showcases my efforts in implementing the concepts and techniques learned during the course, including HTML, CSS, and other web development tools.</p>
